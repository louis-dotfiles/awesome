# Awesome window manager configuration README

WIP

Awesome has dogshit API and naming conventions.
No lua type annotations either.



The `awesome` variable is global, don't ask.


# BUTTTONS!

WTF is this number in the `awful.button` function??
The author couldn't be bothered to make an enum for this so here's my
interpretation:
- 1 = left click
- 2 = middle button (scroll wheel)
- 3 = right click
- 4 & 5 = additional side buttons?
